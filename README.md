This is my final project created for the Android Study Jam Vienna.

The app is an on-field supporting app for archeologists helping them to document their excavation activties directly in the
field. Plan is to have different main entries like Aareas/projects, sites, stratigraphical units, features, squares or media
which can be created, updated and viewed.

List views enables you to get a quick overview of each item category.

##Harris Matrix
For later usage it is possible to link stratigraphical units in relation to each other in a way were you specify which SU is
on top and on bottom of current edited SU. The app therefor enables you to select from a list of already created SU in the 
database and secures error inputs in SU numbering.

##ToDo:
A lot of stuff is still missing as this is just the prototype. Currently only the SU is working so far.
